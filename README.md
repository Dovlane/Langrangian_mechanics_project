# Langrangian_mechanics_project

A small bead of mass m is placed so that it can slide without friction on a wire bent like a parabola, z = br^2, where b is a positive constant. The wire rotates about its axis of symmetry with a constant angular velocity ω.

I've chosen arbitrary numerical values for the mass of the bead and the parameter of the parabola, b. Using the Lagrangian approach, I derived the equations of motion under the appropriate constraints and presented them in the form of a system of differential equations. I converted the algebraic constraint equations into differential equations using the constraint stabilization method. For an arbitrarily chosen angular velocity ω, I have depicted various graphs describing the behavior of this mechanical oscillatory system.
